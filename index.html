            <p class="blackjackDescription">Blackjack is a casino game with an illustrious history. While its origin is shrouded in a touch of mystery, it most likely was invented in France around 1700. Originally called "Vingt-et-Un", or "Twenty-One" when translated to English, it was played at the French Royal Court during the reign of King Louis XV.</p>
            <p class="blackjackDescription">With the help of French colonists in the 18th century, Blackjack soon became closely tied with the American gambling scene. It was played all across the country, notably in New Orleans and California. While the years have added and subtracted from the original rules, the spirit of Blackjack is still very much alive today.</p>
